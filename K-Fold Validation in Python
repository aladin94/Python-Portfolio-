##After you finish train/test/splitting your data, and scaling the data, and once you've chosen the classifier for the model, you can finally use K-Fold Cross Validation to measure the accuracy of your model!

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
accuracies = cross_val_score(estimator = classifier, X = X_train, y = y_train, cv=10)

#Here we create an 'accuracies' variable which will be a vector that holds the scores of the accuracies. The paramaters include the estimator (which is the classifier object of which ML algorithm you choose, X & Y variables are the data you are plugging in, and cv stands for the number of Folds you want to test with, 10 being the norm.

To test the variance or mean of the accuracies, simply run this code:
accuracies.mean() or accuracies.std()
