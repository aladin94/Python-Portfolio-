# Python-Portfolio-

Miscellaneous projects with Python! 

Some are directly from MOOC Coursework  websites including Udemy, EDX, Coursera. 

Others are personal projects that I've decided to analyze out of curiousity or to challenge myself.

Main objective is to practice Python skills using SciPy, Numpy, Pandas libraries, while keeping aware of Python's style as well as OOS principles.
