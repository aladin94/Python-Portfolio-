### Import Time module to be used in our background process; the program will essentially check (every 5 seconds) whether the time is between 9PM-2AM. If so, it will "ban" me from accessing the sites included in "website_lists", during those hour to prevent me from being distracted. Therefore, making me more productive (hopefully)!

import time
from datetime import datetime as dt

### Various variables being instantiated to objects that we'll need for our While loop. 
hosts_temp = "hosts"
hosts_path= r"C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
redirect="127.0.0.1"
website_list=["www.yahoo.com", "www.reddit.com","www.youtube.com"]

### This While loop will use Datetime's calendar methods to compare whether the current moment is between the provided time ranges (21:00-02:00). Clearly, I'm a bit of a night owl. If it's currently Work Time, the program will add the website_list items to my host file, which will in turn ban me from visiting those sites and redirect me to a local ip.

while True:
    if dt(dt.now().year,dt.now().month,dt.now().day,21) < dt.now() < dt(dt.now().year,dt.now().month,dt.now().day, 2):
        print ("Time to work!")
        with open(hosts_path, 'r+') as file:
            content=file.read()
            for website in website_list:
                if website in content:
                    pass
                else:
                    file.write(redirect+" "+ website+"\n")
    else:
        with open(hosts_path, 'r+') as file:
            content=file.readlines()
            file.seek(0)
            for line in content:
                if not any(website in line for website in website_list):
                    file.write(line)
                file.truncate()
            print("Break Time!")
        time.sleep(5)
